# TI-string-buffer

This is an attempt to create a module for doing memory management for storing strings on a TI-99/4a in Assembly code.

STRBUF.TXT contains the source code for the module. This is the only file you would need if using this module in a larger program.
STRTST.TXT contains the source code for some unit tests.
TESTUTIL.TXT is also related to unit tests.

If you wish to run unit tests on the code assemble all three source files, load them through E/A option 3, and run RUNTST.
The source files end with the .TXT extension because that seems to be a requirement for my preference of editing the source in NOTEPAD++ and assemblying in the Classic99 emulator.
